When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When you're collaborating on a project, or to have a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	If your project is still in the working stages and it's automatically
 	updated it would be annoying if you introduced a bug and then had that 
 	available to the public.   

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones specifically on GitHub. Clones are copies of repositories.
    Branches are separate lines of commits with unique names. If one was 
    experimenting with a new feature they might create a branch called exp
    to preserve their master branch (and working code) and allow them to 
    experiment with the new feature. Clones are useful for collaborating with
    others. Forks would be great for a newbie like me to be able to take someone
    else's code apart to see how it works without destroying it permanently. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can fetch an updated remote and then merge with any local changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You could use Google Docs. It would be harder because everyone can make changes
    on top of each other and it would be nearly impossible to streamline, but it's
    possible. Git and GitHub seems way easier because people collaborating can see
    and approve changes before they take effect on the master copy which is super
    convenient. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
