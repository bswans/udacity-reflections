How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It didn't - because I wasn't looking closely enough...

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    See where you introduce bugs.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can only save once you finish a part of something you're working on.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because with something like programming it would get outrageous to have super 
    massive numbers of files, especially for small changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log lets you see all the different versions and git diff lets you compare 
    two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can just go back to the working version, makes it easier to try new
    things and make mistakes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Finishing my project/Intro to Programming Nanodegree.
